%Open output stream for releasefixes output
\newoutputstream{releasefixes}

%Open a file, right now, to write to
%\jobname is the name of the compiling job, so we can name our file to match the .tex, .bbl etc files
%First arg. is the filename, second the stream this is for
\immediate\openoutputfile{\jobname.FixBeforeRelease}{releasefixes}

%Text effects for our new command
\newcommand{\fbrtext}[1]{\textcolor{red}{\textbf{#1}}}

%Main command: add text effect to text, and feed the same string into our output file
%We also output the source line number so we can find where the comment is
%Since the final file is to be included as a list, we also include a '\item' directive
%\noexpand makes sure this is written into the file as a command string, not expanded right now like \inputlineno
\newcommand{\fbr}[1]{\fbrtext{#1}\addtostream{releasefixes}{\noexpand\item Line \the\inputlineno : #1}}
